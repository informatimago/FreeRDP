We want to process strings and string lists that are stored in BYTE
arrays, either as char strings or as wide char strings.  To implement
functions that can work on either narrow or wide char strings,  we
will go thru a structure of primitives:

    ref(string, index)->character
    len(string)->length
    inc(string, index)->string

string_funs[0] contains the functions for char strings, while
string_funs[1] contains the functions for wide char strings.
